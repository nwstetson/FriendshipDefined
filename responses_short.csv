Friendships are socially passionate and compassionate interactions
"A social relationship between individuals that is characterized by mostly affiliative behavior, has repeated voluntary social interactions, mostly positive affect when the individuals interact, and some degree of separation distress when unable to interact."
"I reference friendship almost exclusively among humans on a regular basis, so I'd define it as a close social relationship characterized by a mutual desire for reciprocity and a willingness to incur costs in order to benefit the other participant in the relationship."
"Friends are people I enjoy spending time with. I feel invested in knowing what's going on in their lives and want them to know what's going on in mine. Sometimes newer acquaintances can also be described this way but with true friends we exchange thoughts and express feelings freely, deeply."
Friendship is a long-lasting (though it does not need to be lifelong) stable positive social bond between two (or more) individuals which can be characterized by affiliative behaviour or close proximity.
"Friendship is wanting to spend time together, including joint activities and solo activities in proximity and doing so; tolerance, affection, trust, and some intimacy;"
Friendship to me is a relationship that persists through various trials or hardships. It is not exclusive to non-kin and anyone can be friends with one another.
"Friendship is a relationship in which organism (not needed to be related but not excluding family either), in which they offer benefits/tolerate each other"
"It is a state of enduring affection, esteem, intimacy and trust between two people."
