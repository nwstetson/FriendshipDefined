A social relationship between individuals that is characterized by mostly affiliative behavior, has repeated voluntary social interactions, mostly positive affect when the individuals interact, and some degree of separation distress when unable to interact.

A relationship between individuals who are mostly nice to each other, choose to be around each other multiple times, mostly feel happy when they are around each other, and miss each other at least a little bit when they're apart.

Friends are people I enjoy spending time with. I feel invested in knowing what's going on in their lives and want them to know what's going on in mine. Sometimes newer acquaintances can also be described this way but with true friends we exchange thoughts and express feelings freely, deeply.


Friendship to me is a relationship that persists through various trials or hardships. It is not exclusive to non-kin and anyone can be friends with one another.

Friendships are socially passionate and compassionate interactions.
Friendship in chimpanzees are very different, unlike humans who  make different friends at different levels,

Chimpanzees form friendship for various reasons:
Security
Maternal relations


Male chimps make friends with each other because they seek for security incase, it's where you find alpha or high ranking males in one cohort, they're able to defend each other in case of attack. And it Is easy for them to move on and acquaint with others if they prove to be more secure around than the latter.  Even though they are friends,  some have to be pleased than others, they fight and cry and later submit to the big one. The friendship here is not deeper like humans, it's just on purpose 

Female chimps also make friends to hung out with, usually mothers together and the young girls, these offer each other support, compony and alerts away from their protectors, the males.  New immigrant females stick around the males cos they usually face rejection from old females in the community while males welcome and reassure.

Maternal chimps tend to have a very strong bond, they defend each other but never fight against each other, they come back to seek for one another and groom frequently if found. ( Carter Peterson), (Rollins Damien) ( Evan's Booker) (Bach wayne) (Joya yoyo) (Hutcherson Richmond).
There wasn't a fight  for hutcherson to take over Richmond for alpha, it was a threat from Hutcherson and submission by Richmond, not like Bartok and Mweya (I heard there was a big fight to overthrow Mweya for Bartok to reign).

Friendship is a relationship between organisms (not needed to be related but not excluding family either), in which they offer benefits/tolerate each other

Friendship is wanting to spend time together, including joint activities and solo activities in proximity and doing so; tolerance, affection, trust, and some intimacy;


It is a state of enduring affection, esteem, intimacy and trust between two people.

I reference friendship almost exclusively among humans on a regular basis, so I'd define it as a close social relationship characterized by a mutual desire for reciprocity (that isn't always realized in actuality; e.g. one person paying for dinner twice in a row because the other is having trouble affording food) and a willingness to incur costs in order to benefit the other participant in the relationship (e.g. one person giving their only jacket to their friend when it's cold outside).

Friendship is a long-lasting (though it does not need to be lifelong) stable positive social bond between two (or more) individuals which can be characterized by affiliative behaviour or close proximity.
